#Simple Breakout

## How to play

Open "Breakout.scene" in Scenes folder. Click "play". Left-click mouse or click "left ctrl" button to "fire" the ball out, and use <- and ->, or A and D buttons to control paddle to move.

When bricks break, there are golds droping down, you can use paddle to collect them.

If you miss the ball, you lose.

It's an "endless" game right now, so you should try to collect as much Golds as you can.

If you break all the bricks, you level up. The score will keep.

Bricks will become more since level increases.

You may find that some bricks need more than one collision by the ball to break it.
